Hi, this is gonna be a folder which I could save my "basic" projects. Some examples of these projects are a 3D Cube, calculators, dropdowns bars, etc.
I would like to upload 1 simple projects everyday while I'm doing bigger projects. 
These projects could help to do a webpage 'cause you can find some tools for your project.
Example: I need a music player por my webpage/app, I'll just need to look for it through the folder.
In this readme file I'll post the title, some description and an image of each project to give a general idea to you. 

#1 Music Player

This is an app to play music. You can pass the song or comeback.
